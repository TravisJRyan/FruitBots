# FruitBots
A submission for FruitBots (fruitbots.org), an AI bot competition where bots on a grid chase after pieces of fruit. This bot is currently at an intermediate skill level, and there are still changes in the future that could be made for more optimal performance. 

Future Plans:
~a more thorough "needFruit" function that prioritizes some fruits over another based on location, point value, and scarcity on the board
~an incorporated awareness of where the opponent is and which fruits are not worth chasing after
